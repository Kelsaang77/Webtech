    <p>The Nepal Tibetan Lhamo Association in Kathmandu is a non-profit organization established in 1976 with the purpose of preserving and promoting the unique Tibetan culture, especially the Lhamo, a Tibetan opera. It was founded at the grassroots level and has been dedicated to the preservation of the 14th century Lhamo culture since its inception. The main objective is to preserve and promote the ancient art and culture of Tibet, with a focus on the Lhamo opera dance. The origin of Lhamo can be traced back to the 14th century when the Tibetan saint Thangtong Gyalpo built iron bridges in Tibet and used a performance of the Lhamo opera to gather donations for the laborers. This was the first time the Lhamo dance was introduced in Tibet.</p>
